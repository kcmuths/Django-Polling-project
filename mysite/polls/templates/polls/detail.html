<!--The template system uses the dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. below {{question.question_text}}, first Django does a dictionary lookup on the object question, on failing this it tries a attribute lookup -which works here. If attribute lookup fails it would
have tried a list-index lookup -->



<h1>{{question.question_text}}</h1>
<ul>
{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
	<li>{{choice.choice_text }}</li>

{% endfor %}
</ul>
